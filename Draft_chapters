1. What is statistics?
- World
- Process
- Model
- Deterministic Model
- Statistical Model
- This is what statistics trying to do

2. Statistical Model
- Mathematical notation for statistical model
- Probability distribution
- Discrete probability distribution
- Famous discrete probability distributions
- Continuous probability distribution
- Famous continuous probability distribution

3. How can statistical model be known? (parameter estimation)
- What does it means to know?
- Expectation / estimation
- Data reduce models uncertainty
- Frequentist paradigm
- Bayesian paradigm
- Philosophical consequences
- Law of large numbers
- Bias of estimation
- Example: biasedness of standard deviation and Bessel's correction

4. Frequentist paradigm parameter estimation
- One-ness of true process
- Histogram as estimate of pdf
- Parametric parameter estimation (using distribution, assumptions, likelihood, MLE, Method of moments [what statistician usually do])
- Non-parametric parameter estimation (histogram, kernel density estimation, generalized method of moments)

5. Frequentist based inference
- What does it means to infer?
- Simulation(?)
- Hypothesis testing
- P-value
- Confidence interval
- Power law

6. Bayesian paradigm parameter estimation
- Distribution based parameter
- Bayes theorem
- MAP

7. Bayesian based inference
- Probability
- Confidence interval
- Bayes factor
